SSH Security Audit Checklist
===========================

1. SSH Service & Installation Checks
   □ Verify SSH server installation
   □ Check SSH service status (systemctl)
   □ Verify SSH daemon process (sshd)
   □ Check SSH version

2. SSH Configuration Security
   □ Check PermitRootLogin setting
   □ Verify PasswordAuthentication setting
   □ Ensure Protocol is set to 2
   □ Check for non-standard SSH port
   □ Verify sshd_config file exists and location

3. SSH Key Management
   □ Verify SSH key permissions:
     - Private keys (600)
     - Public keys (644)
     - authorized_keys file (600)
   □ Validate key types and strengths:
     - RSA keys >= 3072 bits
     - ED25519 keys presence
   □ Check host keys:
     - Presence of host keys
     - Count of available host keys
     - Key fingerprints and types

4. Access Control & Authentication
   □ Review AllowUsers/DenyUsers settings
   □ Check MaxAuthTries setting (recommend 3-4)
   □ Monitor failed login attempts:
     - Count in auth.log
     - Failed attempts by IP (top 10)
     - Concurrent login attempts
   □ Check recent SSH connections (last command)

5. File & Directory Permissions
   □ SSH directory (/etc/ssh) permissions (755)
   □ User's ~/.ssh directory permissions (700)
   □ SSH host keys permissions (600)
   □ Verify file ownership:
     - SSH directory (root:root)
     - Config files (root:root)
     - User SSH directory (user:user)

6. Network Security
   □ Check SSH listening ports:
     - Using netstat
     - Using ss (socket statistics)
   □ Verify firewall rules:
     - UFW rules for SSH
     - IPTables rules for SSH
   □ Check brute-force protection:
     - Fail2ban installation
     - Fail2ban SSH jail status

7. Crypto Settings
   □ Review enabled ciphers
   □ Check key exchange algorithms:
     - List available algorithms
     - Identify weak algorithms (sha1, diffie-hellman-group1)
   □ Verify MAC algorithms:
     - List available algorithms
     - Identify weak algorithms (md5, sha1)

8. Logging & Monitoring
   □ Check SSH logging configuration:
     - LogLevel setting
     - Log file presence
   □ Analyze login patterns:
     - Login attempts by hour
     - Failed login attempts
     - Concurrent login attempts
   □ Monitor authentication:
     - Failed password attempts
     - Authentication failures by IP
     - Unusual login patterns

9. Additional Security Checks
   □ Process Status:
     - SSH daemon running status
     - Process details and ownership
   □ Service Management:
     - Systemd service status
     - Service startup configuration
   □ Port Status:
     - Port availability
     - Port listening status

10. Security Recommendations
    □ Generate critical security recommendations
    □ Prioritize recommendations by severity:
      - Critical (A level)
      - High (B level)
      - Medium (C level)
      - Low (D level)
    □ Provide specific remediation steps

11. Audit Logging
    □ Log all check results
    □ Include timestamp for each check
    □ Record warning and error messages
    □ Save full audit report
