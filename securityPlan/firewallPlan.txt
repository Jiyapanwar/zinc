Firewall & IPTables Security Audit Checklist
===========================================

1. Firewall Service Status Checks
   □ Verify UFW/IPTables installation status
   □ Check firewall service status (systemctl)
   □ Verify if firewall is enabled at boot
   □ Confirm default policies:
     - INPUT chain policy
     - OUTPUT chain policy
     - FORWARD chain policy
   □ Check nftables status and configuration
   □ Verify service startup configuration

2. Rule Configuration Audit
   □ Review active firewall rules:
     - List all UFW rules
     - List all IPTables rules
     - Document custom chains
   □ Verify critical port status:
     - SSH (22)
     - HTTP (80)
     - HTTPS (443)
     - Database ports
   □ Check for:
     - Conflicting rules
     - Redundant rules
     - Rules order efficiency
   □ Analyze rule conflicts:
      - ALLOW/DENY conflicts
      - Duplicate rules detection
      - Port-specific conflicts

3. Network Security Policy Verification
   □ Validate incoming traffic rules:
     - Blocked ports inventory
     - Allowed services list
     - Rate limiting rules
   □ Check outgoing traffic rules:
     - Restricted outbound connections
     - Allowed outbound services
     - Default outbound policy
   □ Verify NAT configuration:
     - SNAT rules
     - DNAT rules
     - Port forwarding setup
   □ Connection tracking:
      - Maximum connections
      - Current connection count
      - Connection state rules

4. Logging & Monitoring Configuration
   □ Verify logging settings:
     - Dropped packets logging
     - Accepted connections logging
     - Log file location and permissions
   □ Check rate limiting:
     - Connection tracking status
     - Concurrent connection limits
     - Per-IP connection limits
   □ Monitor suspicious activity:
     - Failed connection attempts
     - Port scan attempts
     - DDoS indicators
   □ Periodic monitoring:
      - Automated checks every 15 minutes
      - Change detection
      - Email alerts for significant changes

5. Security Best Practices Validation
   □ Verify anti-spoofing rules:
     - Reverse path filtering
     - Invalid packet dropping
     - Source routing protection
   □ Check state tracking:
     - ESTABLISHED,RELATED rules
     - Invalid state drops
     - State table size limits
   □ Validate security measures:
     - SYN flood protection
     - ICMP handling rules
     - Fragment handling rules

6. Backup and Recovery
   □ Automated backup functionality:
      - UFW rules backup
      - IPTables rules backup
      - nftables rules backup
   □ Backup management:
      - Timestamped backups
      - Secure backup storage
      - Backup rotation
   □ Restore capabilities:
      - Selective rule restoration
      - Backup verification
      - Rollback options

7. Security Analysis and Reporting
   □ Threat level assessment:
      - Critical (A level) risks
      - High (B level) risks
      - Medium (C level) risks
      - Low (D level) risks
   □ Compliance checking:
      - Security requirements
      - Rule validation
      - Configuration assessment
   □ Recommendations:
      - Critical security fixes
      - Configuration improvements
      - Best practice alignment
