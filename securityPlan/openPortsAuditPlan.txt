Open Ports Check Audit Checklist
==========================================

1. Port Scanning and Detection

□ Verify Nmap installation
□ Perform a full TCP port scan
□ Identify open ports
□ List services running on open ports

2. Service Verification

□ Check services bound to critical ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443)
□ Verify unexpected services on non-standard ports
□ Validate active services with ss or netstat

3. Firewall and IPTables Rules

□ Check if UFW is installed and active
□ Review current UFW rules for allowed/denied ports
□ List IPTables rules for open ports
□ Confirm SSH and HTTP/S ports are explicitly allowed

4. Security Assessment

□ Highlight ports exposing unnecessary services
□ Detect services with default configurations
□ Assess weak or insecure services (e.g., Telnet, FTP)
□ Verify if critical ports are protected with firewalls

5. Recommendations for Security

□ Disable unnecessary services on open ports
□ Change non-standard port numbers for critical services
□ Enforce firewall rules for unused ports
□ Regularly monitor new open ports and services

6. Audit Logging

□ Log all open ports and their associated services
□ Include timestamp for scan execution
□ Record warning messages for insecure configurations
□ Save full port scan report
