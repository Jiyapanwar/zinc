# zinc: automated security audits for Linux servers and desktops

### Project Idea: Custom Linux Security Scanner

*Objective*:  
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive shell script that scans a Linux system for common security vulnerabilities. The script will identify potential risks such as open ports, weak passwords, unauthorized access attempts, malware, and misconfigurations, providing actionable recommendations to enhance the security of the system.

#### *Real-life Use Case*:
Linux systems, especially those used in production environments, need to be secure to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats. A Custom Linux Security Scanner automates the process of checking for security weaknesses, making it easier for system administrators to maintain the integrity and safety of their systems. This tool is useful for routine security audits, compliance checks, and in scenarios where systems are exposed to the internet or connected to sensitive networks.

#### *Key Features*:

1. *Open Ports Check*:
   - Uses tools like Nmap to scan for open ports and services running on those ports.
   - Provides a report on which ports should be closed or have restricted access based on best security practices.

2. *Weak Password Detection*:
   - Utilizes Hashcat or custom scripts to test the strength of user passwords.
   - Checks for default, weak, or commonly used passwords and suggests improvements.

3. *Malware and Rootkit Detection*:
   - Scans the system for known malware and rootkits using tools like chkrootkit or rkhunter.
   - Monitors the system for suspicious activities or unauthorized changes to critical files.

4. *Log File Analysis*:
   - Analyzes system log files to detect failed login attempts, unusual access patterns, or other signs of a breach.
   - Generates alerts for system administrators if any anomalies are detected.

5. *File and Directory Permissions*:
   - Inspects file and directory permissions to ensure they are set correctly, preventing unauthorized access.
   - Checks for SUID/SGID files that could be potential security risks.

6. *SSH Security*:
   - Checks SSH configuration for weaknesses, such as allowing root login or using weak encryption ciphers.
   - Recommends changes to harden the SSH service, including setting up key-based authentication.

7. *Firewall and IPTables Check*:
   - Verifies that the system's firewall (e.g., IPTables) is configured properly.
   - Suggests rules to block unnecessary traffic and enhance network security.

8. *Hidden and Unmonitored Services*:
   - Detects hidden services that are running without proper monitoring.
   - Lists services that may have been overlooked in the system's security policy.

#### *Topics This Project Covers*:

- *Security Measures in Linux*: The project involves implementing security best practices, including checking and configuring SSH, firewall settings, and permissions.
- *Network Penetration Testing Tools*: Using Wireshark, Nmap, and Hashcat to test the systemâ€™s network security and password strength.
- *Threats and Vulnerabilities Analysis*: Understanding and detecting various threats such as open ports, weak passwords, malware, and improper configurations.
- *Shell Scripting*: Writing scripts to automate the entire scanning process, generate reports, and even take corrective actions based on findings.
- *Permissions and Access Control Lists*: Inspecting and correcting file permissions and user access control to secure the file system.

---

#### *Implementation Steps*:

1. *Initial Setup*:
   - Create a shell script that will serve as the main entry point for the security scanner.
   - Ensure the script has the necessary permissions and dependencies to perform security checks (e.g., Nmap, Hashcat, etc.).

2. *Open Ports and Services Check*:
   - Implement the Nmap scan within the script to identify open ports.
   - Log the findings and suggest closing or restricting access to unnecessary ports.

3. *Password Strength Testing*:
   - Integrate Hashcat or another password-checking mechanism to test user passwords.
   - Output a list of users with weak passwords and recommend stronger alternatives.

4. *Malware and Rootkit Detection*:
   - Run chkrootkit or rkhunter from within the script to search for malware.
   - Provide a summary of any detected threats and potential actions to remove them.

5. *Log Analysis*:
   - Write code to parse and analyze system logs, looking for signs of suspicious activity.
   - Implement alerts for specific types of events, such as repeated failed login attempts.

6. *Permissions and File Security*:
   - Scan file and directory permissions using the script to ensure they are set according to best practices.
   - Report and fix any misconfigured permissions.

7. *Final Report Generation*:
   - Compile the results of all checks into a comprehensive report.
   - Include recommendations and potential fixes for all detected vulnerabilities.
